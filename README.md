Hi Guys!

  I'm Maria, 22 years, software engineering student at PUC, in the fourth period and internship in Big Data and Cloud, mainly that's the area where i'm trying to build knowledge.
  Besides that, i’m interested in Data Engineering, Security and Innovation.
  
  I’m currently learning about SQL, DBMS, Python, Java and Azure.
  
I also like to tell that i love learn new things, arts (including music, especially bass and theatre) and reading.
