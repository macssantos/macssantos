Hi Guys!

  I'm Maria, 21 years, software engineering student at PUC, in the third period and internship in DataBase, mainly that's the area where i'm trying to build knowledge.
  Besides that, i’m interested in Data Engineering, Security and Innovation.
  
  I’m currently learning about SQL, DBMS, Python and Java.
  
I also like to tell that i love learn new things, arts (including music, especially bass and theatre) and reading.
